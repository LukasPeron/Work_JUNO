"""
Calibration of Total Waveform Charge (Q) vs Number of Photoelectrons (NPE)

This script is designed to perform the calibration of the total waveform charge (Q) as a function of the number of 
photoelectrons (NPE) using data from ELECSIM and DETSIM simulations.

Created by: Lukas Peron
Last Update: 22/08/2024

Overview:
---------
The script performs the following steps:
1. Load and process ELECSIM data, summing up the waveform charge for each true event ID (TrueEvtID).
2. Save the processed ELECSIM data to a text file for further analysis.
3. (Optional) Load and process DETSIM data, correlating the ELECSIM events with the corresponding DETSIM events based 
   on event IDs.
4. Save the processed DETSIM data to a text file for further analysis.

Notes:
------
- If the script is working with ADC peak values instead of integrated waveform charge, modifications are noted in the comments.
- The section for DETSIM data processing can be commented out if the peak calibration has already been completed.

Dependencies:
-------------
- ROOT
- my_package (contains `elec_branches`, `detsim_branches`, and `useful_function`)
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy

Instructions:
-------------
1. Ensure that ROOT and the required Python packages are installed.
2. Provide the ELECSIM file number when prompted.
3. The script will automatically process the data and save the results in the specified directory.
