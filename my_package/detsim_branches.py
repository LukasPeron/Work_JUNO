Loading DETSIM Files, Trees, and Branches

This script provides utility functions for loading ROOT files, extracting trees, and retrieving branches and attributes
from the DETSIM simulation data. It includes error handling to ensure that the file and tree loading processes work
as expected.

Created by: Lukas PÃ©ron
Last Update: 22/08/2024

Overview:
---------
The script includes the following functions:
1. `load_file(number)`: Opens a DETSIM ROOT file based on a provided identifier number.
2. `load_branches(tree, *kwargs)`: Retrieves specified branches from a given tree.
3. `load_attributes(entry, *kwargs)`: Extracts attributes from a specific tree entry.

Error Handling:
---------------
- The `load_file` function checks if the ROOT file is successfully opened. If the file cannot be opened or is corrupted
  (zombie file), an error is raised with a descriptive message.
- The `load_branches` and `load_attributes` functions assume that the provided branch or attribute names are valid. 
  If invalid names are provided, the function will raise an `AttributeError` or return `None`, depending on the ROOT framework's behavior.

Dependencies:
-------------
- ROOT

Instructions:
-------------
1. Ensure that ROOT is installed and configured in your environment.
2. Use the `load_file` function to open the desired DETSIM ROOT file.
3. Use `load_branches` and `load_attributes` to extract the necessary data from the tree.
